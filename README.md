### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Jesse Kelly. I'm glad you made it to my Github page. I'm a Fullstack Engineer and digital nomad currently living in Mexico City, MX. I love functional programming(especially on the fronetend with technologies such as fp-ts, io-ts, and cyclejs), languages, and solving problems. 

Send me a message, I would love to hear from you. I am a native English(ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸) speaker and speak Spanish(ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡½) fluently.
